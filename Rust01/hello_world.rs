fn main(){
    println!("hello rust...");
}

/*
    1. create hello_world.rs file
    2. fn main() this is th main function and start point of our program
    3. println!() is a macro which we will learn later
    4. dont forget the ; at the end of each line
    5. save the file and run "rustc hello_world.rs"
        5.1. this will create an executable file named "hello_world"
    6. at last we run the created executable file "./hello_world"
